Description (version 0.3.0):

This is a simple plugin, that displays the status of the
available dvb devices. This maybe helps in case of driver
problems. 
For every device it is shown
* its type (DVB-T, DVB-C (not tested), DVB-S)
* its name 
* its /dev path (/dev/dvb/adapter*)
* its current recordings with their start time and title. 
  Selecting a recording and pressing 'ok' starts it for
  timeshift viewing.
  Press the red key to toggle the recordings display. 
* the channels the device is currently tuned to. 
  The live channel is marked with a plus sign. 
  The channels are selectable; pressing OK switches to this channel 
  (without leaving the plugin). Pressing the keys "7" or "9"
  will change to the closest transponder with lower or higher frequency
  Press the yellow key to show/hide this channel display. 
* the signal strength and the signal / noise ratio of
  the device. Hint: Some devices do not provide this info.
  Press the green key to toggle the signal display. 
  Press the blue key to refresh the screen (and thus the values)
* The card which delivers the live view is marked with the text "live" 
* the settings are retained between saisons
* there is also a little setup page
  
This plugin is heavily based  on the recstatus plugin by 
Christian Wieninger and Mike Constabel 
(http://www.constabel.net/vdr/plugins.de.htm). 
To cry it out loudly: devstatus is a renamed version with
additional code. I changed the name to "devstatus" 
because three of four information this plugin provides 
aren't connected to recordings anymore.

Joe_D at vdr-portal.de implemented the automatic repaint of the screen
as soon as channel are switched or recording starts or stops.
Thanks


I used also some code from the femon plugin 
(http://www.saunalahti.fi/~rahrenbe/vdr/femon/).
