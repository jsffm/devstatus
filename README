Description (version 0.2.0):

This is a simple plugin, that displays the status of the
available dvb devices. This maybe helps in case of driver
problems. 
For every device it is shown
* its type (DVB-T, DVB-C (not tested), DVB-S)
* its name 
* its /dev path (/dev/dvb/adapter*)
* its current recordings with their start time and title. 
  Selecting a recording and pressing 'ok' starts it for
  timeshift viewing.
  Press the red key to toggle the recordings display. 
* the channels the device is currently tuned to. 
  The live channel is marked with a plus sign. 
  The channels are selectable; pressing OK switches to this channel 
  (without leaving the plugin). Pressing ChannelUp or ChannelDown
  will change to the next transponder. The keys "7" and "9"
  have the same purpose.
  Press the yellow key to toggle the channel display. 
* the signal strength and the signal / noise ratio of
  the device. Hint: Some devices do not provide this info.
  Press the green key to toggle the signal display. 
  Press the blue key to refresh the screen (and thus the values)
* The actual used card ist marked with the text "live" 
  
This plugin is heavily based  on the recstatus plugin by 
Christian Wieninger and Mike Constabel 
(http://www.constabel.net/vdr/plugins.de.htm). 
To cry it out loudly: devstatus is a renamed version with
additional code. I changed the name to "devstatus" 
because three of four information this plugin provides 
aren't connected to recordings anymore.

I used also some code from the femon plugin 
(http://www.saunalahti.fi/~rahrenbe/vdr/femon/).
