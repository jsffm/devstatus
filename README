Description:

This is a simple plugin, that displays the recording status of the
available devices. Each device shows its current recordings with
their start time and title. Selecting a recording and pressing 'ok'
starts it for timeshift viewing.

The purpose for writing this, was for special testing of my
configuration. So its unlikely that this plugin will be maintained,
atleast not from me ;-) But perhaps, someone will find it useful.

Have fun!
